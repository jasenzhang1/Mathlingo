  summary:
    "Split the design into two blocks, X = [X₁, X₂], and ask what the coefficient on X₂ really is. The " +
    "answer — the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem — is that β̂₂ is exactly what you get by first removing " +
    "from both y and X₂ everything X₁ can explain, then regressing one set of residuals on the other. " +
    "That single fact explains what 'holding the other variables fixed' means, why orthogonal columns " +
    "can be fitted one at a time, and how every quantity changes when a variable is added.",
